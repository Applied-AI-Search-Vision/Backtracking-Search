Introduction
Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

This repository offers a solution to the Sudoku puzzle using the backtracking algorithm, which is a trial-and-error-based approach to solving problems.

Algorithm Overview
Start from the first cell of the Sudoku grid.
For each cell, try placing numbers from 1 to 9.
Check if the current number being placed is valid for the current cell.
If the number is valid, move to the next cell and repeat step 2.
If no number is valid for the current cell, backtrack to the previous cell and try the next number.
Continue this process until the Sudoku is solved or determined to be unsolvable.
